# Splunk-Enterprise-Tool

## Overview

This repository contains exercises focused on using Splunk Enterprise platform tool for adding data, searching data, and creating simple dashboards.
**Indexing** - The process of transforming the data is called indexing. During indexing, the incoming data is processed to enable fast searching and analysis. The index is a flat file repository for the data

**Events** - The processed results are stored in the index as events. Events are stored in the index as a group of files that fall into two categories:
**Raw data** - which is the data that you add to the Splunk deployment. The raw data is stored in a compressed format.
**Index files** - which include some metadata files that point to the raw data.
