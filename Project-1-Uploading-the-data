## Introduction

In this project, we will use Wireshark to capture, filter and analyze HTTP traffic. HTTP traffic analysis is crucial for understanding web communication, identifying potential security issues, and investigating anomalies in network traffic.

## Lab Set-up and Tools

1. **Tool**: Wireshark v4.2.6
2. **Web Browser**: Chrome for generating HTTP traffic.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Capture HTTP Traffic
